    <h3 id="Animals1">Atlantic Spotted Dolphins Characteristics</h3>
    <p>The Atlantic Spotted Dolphin (Stenella frontalis) is a dolphin found in the Gulf Stream of the North Atlantic Ocean. Older members of the species have a very distinctive spotted coloration all over their body. <strong> full size Atlantic Spotted Dolphins are about 2.2 – 2.5 metres in length and weigh around 200 pounds</strong>. Atlantic Spotted Dolphins may easily be confused with the Common Bottlenose Dolphin and the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin when observed at sea.

        In common with other species in its genus the Atlantic Spotted Dolphins is a gregarious creature. The Atlantic Spotted Dolphin is a fast swimmer, keen bow-rider and prone to acrobatic aerial displays.
        
        Atlantic spotted dolphins have between 32 and 42 teeth in each row of the upper jaw and between 30 and 40 teeth in each row of the lower jaw.</p>

        <h3 id="Animals2">Bengal Tiger Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Bengal tigers also have large, retractable claws that allow them to climb and kill prey. Their stripes help them camouflage as they stalk their prey. Bengal tigers have excellent vision and good hearing.

            <strong> heaviest Bengal Tiger ever reported was 389.5 kilograms. Female Bengal tigers are considerably smaller and have an average weight of 141 kilograms (310 pounds), but they can weigh up to 180 kilograms (400 pounds).</p>

        <h3 id="Animals3">Black Footed Ferret Characteristics</h3>
        <p>he black footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), also known as the American polecat or prairie dog hunter, is a species of mustelid belonging to the Mustelidae and the genus Mustela. The black-footed ferret is similar in appearance to the European polecat and the Asian steppe polecat.

            The black-footed ferret is native to central North America and are the only native species of ferrets native to North America. The domestic ferrets that you find in pet stores (Mustela furo) share the same genus, but these are of European origin and have been domesticated for hundreds of years.The black footed ferret has a long, slender body. These animals are sexually dimporhic, <strong> males measuring between 500 and 533 millimetres (19.7 and 21.0 in) long with a tail length of 114 to 127 millimetres (4.5 to 5.0 in), and females being about 10% smaller. They weigh between 650 and 1,400 grams (1.43 and 3.09 lb)</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="Animals4">Wild Cat </h2>
        <img src="/Cats.jpg" alt="image">
        <h3 id="Animals4">Wild Cat Behaviour</h3>
        <p>The Wild cat is extremely timid. It avoids approaching human settlements. The wild cat lives solitarily and holds a territory of about 3 kilometres squared. Males overlap ranges with females, however, females will not overlap ranges with other females.

            Wildcats are mainly crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk). As is the case with all the smaller cats, wildcats cannot roar, however, they do use a variety of other sounds to communicate including growling, meowing, purring and hissing.</p>
            <h3 id="Animals4">Wild Cat Reproduction</h3>
            <p>Wild cats mate in February and March and produce 1 litter of 3 – 5 kittens after a gestation period of 63 – 68 days. Kittens are born with hair but are blind and deaf. Their eyes open after 9 days and they emerge from the den at 4 – 5 weeks old. They accompany their mother on hunting trips after 10 – 12 weeks. Second litters occasionally occur in August. Wild cats have an average life span of 12 years.</p>

        <h2 id="Animals5">Chipmunk</h2>
        <img src="/Chipmunk.jpg" alt="image">
        <h3 id="Animals5">Chipmunk Habitat</h3>
        <p>Chipmunks are generally seen scampering through the undergrowth of a variety of environments from scrublands, alpine forests to shrubby deserts. Chipmunks construct complex burrows which can measure 3 – 4 metres in length. These burrows have several entrances, tunnels and chambers for sleeping which are kept very clean. Shells and faeces are stored in refuse tunnels. sleeping areas are enlarged and filled with shredded leaves to make a comfortable bed. Food is normally stored in the lowest tunnels, to keep it cool and fresh. Some species of chipmunk make their homes in logs, bushes are abandoned nests.</p>
        <h3 id="Animals5">Chipmunk Diet</h3>
        <p>Chipmunks have a varied omnivorous diet mainly consisting of nuts, fruits, seeds, berries, grains, birds eggs, small frogs, fungi, insects and worms. Food is stuffed into their large cheek pouches and carried back to store in their dens. Lots of food is gathered and placed in their burrows at the beginning of autumn to store for the winter.

            Some species of chipmunk make many caches of food. These two behaviours are referred to as ‘larder hoarding’ and ‘scatter hoarding’. Larder hoarders usually remain in their nests until spring. Chipmunks generally gather food on the ground in areas with underbrush, rocks and logs, where they can hide from predators like hawks, foxes, coyotes, weasels, and snakes. They will climb trees to collect acorns and hazel nuts, however, they are not as agile as their cousins, the squirrel.
            
            Chipmunks fulfil several important functions in forest ecosystems. Their activities which include harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role in seedling establishment. Chipmunks also play an important role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds, however, they are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regards to bird eggs and nestlings.</p>
